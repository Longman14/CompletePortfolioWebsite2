    <article id="abouttext"><h2>About me</h2>
    My name is Hassan Damilola. I'm a graduate from the University of Technology, Akure. I studied physics electronics. Fortunately and unfortunately, I discovered I didn't have passion for the course in my third year and I set out to find something I'm really passionate about. I love music, football, and video games. My favourite food is rice and dodo - yep, I said it, and I'm not a dullard. Other fun facts about me can be gotten from my Dm. I'm just a chat away to answer all your question because I don't want to leave too much informantion.

    <section id="Experience">
      <p>
        I first came across coding in the year 2019 during my Industrial training, where I took a beginner's course on HTML, CSS, and php. Since then I've been passionate about becoming a programmer even though other activities have stolen my attention all in a bid to make daily 2k. But now, I've devoted myself for pursuing a career in programming. I've worked as a junior engineer at a company that installs access control systems. I currently write youtube contents and email copies, have a bit of wordpress design and graphics design.
